						<p>The History of the Catapult</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/catapultpic.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Catapults were first invented in Ancient Greek and Roman times and originated in China around the 3rd and 4th century BC. In 400 BCE, Dionysius the elder of Syracuse invented the catapult. It was also said to be invented by soldiers. A Catapult is a device that accumulates tension that is released to hurl an object from a distance. It can launch things up to a distance of 500 to 1,000 feet.</p>
					<p>They were usually set on higher ground or on castles towers to allow them to shoot farther. The catapult was not something that was just invented one day, it was developed slowly over time. In 1485, Leonardo Da Vinci redesigned the catapult and used the springlike energy stored in bent wood to give power to the swing arm. Originally, crossbows were invented but then got larger and larger until they were considered catapults. It became a weapon that was used in warfare and remained throughout medieval times. Since they were very common in warfare, the training to operate it was needed by soldiers. Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian, was the first to document the use of mechanical arrow firing catapult in 399 BC.</p>
					<p>Various types of catapults have been used by the Greeks, Romans, and Chinese. The main types of catapults are Ballista, The Springald, Mangonel, and trebuchet. The Ballista was a giant crossbow, it was created to amply the range and the power of the crossbow and was the earliest catapult. The springald was a smaller version of the Ballista used in tighter confines such as castles or towers. It was utilized mostly as antipersonnel weapon. The mangonel was invented by the romans in 400 BC. The Mangonel was easy to construct and wheels were added to the design to help increase its mobility. The trebuchet was designed to be at maximum force. It arrived in Europe around 500 AD. The trebuchet was the most feared and hated siege weapon around this time period. The most famous trebuchet was the WarWolf, designed and constructed by Master James of St. George, the chief engineer of Edward I.</p>
					<p>Catapults were used to attack a fortress or city until the introduction of the gunpowder cannon in the 14th century. In the Middle Ages, any machine that hurls an object can be considered a catapult. The designs of many catapults worked by a central leaver mounted in counterpoise most like a seesaw movement. Catapults work by storing tension either in twisted ropes or in a flexed piece of wood. A trebuchet tends to be easier to build because it consists simply of a pivoting beam and a counterweight that rotates the beam through an arc, eventually they replaced catapults because they were more effective and could launch projectiles over longer distance. Catapults were also used on aircraft carriers to help launch airplanes, they’re built into the surface of the carrier’s flight deck.</p>
					<p>Nowadays catapults are used to study old weapons, and is often used as fun experiments, usually in physics classes.</p>
