					<p>The internet, computers, the EpiPen, superglue, duct tape, and more. These are all technologies we use everyday. But do you know where they come from? It may surprise you, but all of these examples were developed as a part of the military. There are hundreds of thousands of technological devices which we use daily that have been produced as a result of the military. But just how does the innovation of war technology impact the development of non-war technology?</p>
					<p>	The militaryâ€™s technology has led to the innovation of the internet which we all use today. With the invention of the internet, people were able to express themselves and communicate with others like never before. The internet has made everyday communication and research easier with easy access to the online community. The military also utilizes the internet to store information, design assets, and keep tabs on other nations and their financial situations. Another example of a great technological advancement from military would be the creation of the GPS. GPS, or global positioning system, is used daily by civilians trying to get to a destination.  People commonly use it for different activities like driving, geocaching and finding missing objects. The military has many uses of  the GPS such as plane tracking and handheld receivers. Unmanned drones used by the military also use GPS to navigate and pinpoint the exact locations of dangerous people and missing persons.</p>
					<p>Military technology has lead to many advancements within the medical field. The need for sanitary medical care in war time has caused the need for advanced medical technology such as, vaccinations, prosthetics, penicillin, and more. For example, prosthetics and plastic surgery have dramatically changed the world. Both fields took off during WW2 when there were hundreds of thousands people's physical appearances and bodies were altered due to injuries from the fighting. Penicillin was originally discovered in World War II while looking for ways to prevent deaths by infection. Another example is the EpiPen was originally created and used for quickly injecting in case of chemical warfare or for essential medication. Now, it is a common civilian technology used to prevent severe allergic reactions by providing the necessary medication quickly and easily. Even superglue, which was originally invented while trying to find a material good for clear plastic gun sights, was used in war for quick sealing of wounds, and valued for its ability to stop bleeding quickly.</p>
					<p>Throughout history people and our ways have changed dramatically to better improve life and the standard of living. Without human warfare, the course of history our everyday lives would be greatly altered as war has led to vast technological advancements. War technology has played an important role within many technological fields. Each and every invention that has been patented has further benefited others who were not involved in war. Things such as the internet, the medical field, and advanced technology like computers. All of these creations have revolutionized the world and have forever changed the way humans think and act. Without military conflict many of the everyday technological devices we utilize today would not exist.</p>
